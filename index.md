\textbf{What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?}

I think the most interesting part of the domain so far was being able to visualize my mentor’s, Tiffany’s, data from her 23 and me results in a processed graph from the 1000 Genome dataset. It was the first point where we were able to see how applications of the techniques we’ve been using, in comparison to more cryptic results we would get prior.

\textbf{Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.}

I definitely would like to look deeper into how factors such as age, gender, and race would play into genetic risk. One example question we could answer is how the genetic disease risk of cancer is between European and Asian populations. I will need to do more research into what factors may have more prevalence through exploratory data analysis as well as what disease may be related to such factors.

\textbf{What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?}

I would like to sample for specific factors within the 1000 Genome data rather than using the data as a whole. This would allow us to see how genetic risk is determined by these variables.

\textbf{What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?}

It may be possible for us to run our current analysis over many different factors and diseases. After that we can apply some form of classification algorithm on all the results and pick out the ones that are more determinant.
